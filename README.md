# Learning Causal Knowledge Graphs from Text Log Data

This repository hosts the materials for a seminar paper developed as part of
the [Novel and non-mainstream advances in Data Science course at KIT](https://dbis.ipd.kit.edu/english/3211_3247.php).
The paper focuses on causal discovery from log data, with a special emphasis on time-series data. It provides a
comprehensive review of computational methods for causal discovery, including constraint-based, score-based methods, and
those based on functional causal models.
