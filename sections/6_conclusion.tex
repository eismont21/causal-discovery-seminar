Understanding causal relations helps construct interventions to achieve particular objectives and makes predictions under interventions. The growing accumulation of vast amounts of data necessitates the development of scalable automatic causal search algorithms. This paper has reviewed the step-by-step solution to the time-series data causal discovery challenge. Specifically, I first discussed the preparation phase for the set of log messages because causal discovery algorithms require a suitable structure as input. In this part, I discussed the log parsers and two strategies to create time-series data from log messages. Then, I described four classes of causal inference algorithms: constraint-based, score-based, functional-based methods, and the Granger causality test. If you have a task to explore causality, you can choose one of the proposed algorithms for each step. As a result, you get your algorithm pipeline. Future research directions include solving the missing relationships between two windows by time-series creation and integrating weights to directed edges to discuss the likelihood of causal impact \cite{jarry2021quantitative}.
